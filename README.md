# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Features/Requirements
- If an item in the list is marked "done" make that item display in a different color (without the text “done”)
- Remove the “done” button and switch the done/undone status when the item gets selected / clicked
- Give users the ability to add a new todo item by pressing the “enter” button on your keyboard
- Refactor the code so that you have smaller functions. Each function should be doing only one thing (functional programming paradigm ). Add comments for each function explaining what it does.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
